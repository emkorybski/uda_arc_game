Frogger-like JavaScript arcade game
===============================
To run the game:
1. Open a browser of your choice, ideally Chrome
2. Drag and drop the **index.html** file into an empty browser tab/window
3. Alternatively you can run a local server (e.g Python one or test server associated with your IDE) and access **index.html** that way  

To play the game:
1. Your task is take the main character (little boy in my case) through the pavement towards water so that it does not get hit by bugs.
2. Bugs are coming from left to right at varying speeds. ONce the bug hits you/boy you are coming back to where you started.
3. Use *up*/*down*/*left*/*right* arrows to move the boy.
